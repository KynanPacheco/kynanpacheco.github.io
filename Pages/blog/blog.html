					<p>Welcome to Bigbyshand.com, this is the developer (Xyrack) and this will be the first of my informal dev updates. I have had a lot going on the last 9 months but now with things calming down I hope to get back to this little side project.</p>
					<p>First things first, I have temporary lost the password to the account that would allow me to see reported bugs. I am sure I can get it back but for the time being if any bugs have been reported I am clueless. Second I have been lightly following the google analytics data for the past 9 months and from what I have seen either a small group of people actually use the website or people are stumbling onto it and leaving without a clue. I havent takes a close look yet to see what the situation is but I will.</P>
					<p>Now that I have made a few poorly written statements lets get to what I have actually done today. 1. I have fixed the bug that if there were either no players added or no monsters added the encounters page would bug out (Rather I should say its fixed in all instances I have tested). 2. I started work on the searching/sorting of monsters on the add monster page. This was the last "base feature" of the website I hadn't made yet but im on it now. Its not done yet but I hope to have it done tonight. 3. This unoffial blog.</p>
					<p>Next I would like to talk about where I want to go. As I mentioned the sorting was the last base feature of the website I had yet to do but once that is done I think the next feature I want to work on is making custom monsters. Right now the monster list available is only the SRD (for legal reasons that probably don't even cover me) but I hoped to add the option for users to create and use their own monsters in the website. Initially this will probably manifest itself in when you come to the website you can create your monsters but they wont be there upon return. In the future, persistence of these monsters and even players will be worked on. Beyond my custom monster plan I had some navigational changes I wanted to make (this would also include some minor visual updates) and a more robust player adding system.</p>
					<p>I think thats it for this little entry. I do just want to reiterate that I am an amatuer coder and far from a skilled writer, I will not spell/grammer check these too closely so please dont yell. The Github and source are available to anyone who looks hard enough but I caution against that because it would probably give any developer worth their weight an aneurysm.</p>
					<p>If I do in fact have a real userbase I thank you and hope you enjoy what I am doing. - Xyrack</p>

					<p>Hello, I have implemented some sort of search to the "Add Monsters" page but have not tested it. I can already see a potential bug in the code that I will address at a later date (I have been coding for hours and I got nothing left).</p>
					<p>As I mentioned earlier I am still unsure if there is a userbase here but in the event that there is I have created bigbyshandwebsite@gmail.com that users can send mail to. Feel free to send bugs here until I can get the actual ticket portal back or if you just want to send suggestions or feedback (or WoC sending a cease and desist *sweating profusely*) shoot an email there. I will attempt to check it as often as possible (and maybe respond). - Xyrack</p>
